    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Bill, Kevin, and Randy needed a brand and online platform to transition
      their in-person trademark registration services into a streamlined digital offering.
    </p>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Anyone can file a trademark application online through the USPTO, but the
      application and process are quite confusing if you’re not an attorney.
    </p>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey padding-bottom-2rem">
      Trust Tree is a simplified and attorney-guided service for anyone who
      wants to file a trademark online, but doesn’t want to step foot in an attorney’s office.

      Defining the audience, understanding their problem, and offering a service
      to solve that problem
    </h3>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Our first priority was to make sure we were all in agreement about who the
      target customer was. Together, we created assumption personas based on
      common elements that in-person customers shared, as well as behaviors and
      thought patterns of those who tend to use the online trademark registration
      services offered by competitors.
    </p>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey padding-bottom-2rem">
      The average business owner's experience with the trademarking process varies
      so much that it made sense to break the service up into levels
      (we called them packages) based on how much hand-holding a customer prefers.
      We modeled this structure after TurboTax, as users can self-select
      the desired level of help they receive when filing taxes online.
      Multi-tiered pricing also lets Trust Tree price anchor against themselves,
      rather than the competition.

      We storyboarded the entire user experience from the first point of
      onboarding, to actually signing up, completing a trademark form, events
      that occur during that application process, and maintaining a trademark over time.

      Visual Identity, Branding &amp; Tone
    </h3>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      The logo needed to be strong, memorable, and simple to begin building a brand
      for this new startup. The design behind the Trust Tree logo signifies trust
      and growth, as derived from the name, through the symbolic combination of a tree and key.
    </p>
    <p class="large-4 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey padding-bottom-2rem">
      We established that the tone used through all communications need to
      represent the brand in a friendly and educational way, by using helpful, plain language.
