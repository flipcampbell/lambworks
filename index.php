              Lambworks is a solo product design consultancy, for entrepreneurs

              <p>I began doing design and marketing in the corporate-cubicle-world
                for three long, soul-crushing years. After deciding that office
                politics and inefficient bureaucracy are not for me, I voluntarily
                escaped to go solo during a recession, while all of my colleagues
                were desperately clinging to their jobs.

                Since then, I’ve spent six years helping startups and small
                businesses with design, strategy, and occasionally self-sabotage
                prevention. I prefer working with startups because we share a
                drive to carve your own path while making useful and profitable things.

                Unlike other consultancies, I only accept projects from early
                stage startups when it's clear I can provide a return on
                investment by growing traction or revenue.
