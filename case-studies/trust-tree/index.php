    <h3 class="text-center font-grey">The Story</h3>
    <p class="large-6 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Bill, Kevin, and Randy needed a brand and online platform to transition
      their in-person trademark registration services into a streamlined digital offering.
    </p>
    <p class="large-6 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Anyone can file a trademark application online through the USPTO, but the
      application and process are quite confusing if you’re not an attorney.
    </p>
    <p class="large-6 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Trust Tree is a simplified and attorney-guided service for anyone who
      wants to file a trademark online, but doesn’t want to step foot in an attorney’s office.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="small-12 small-centered columns text-center">

    <h3 class="medium-7 small-12 small-centered columns text-center font-grey">
      Defining the audience, understanding their problem, and offering a service
      to solve that problem
    </h3>
    <p class="large-6 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      Our first priority was to make sure we were all in agreement about who the
      target customer was. Together, we created assumption personas based on
      common elements that in-person customers shared, as well as behaviors and
      thought patterns of those who tend to use the online trademark registration
      services offered by competitors.
    </p>
    <p class="large-6 medium-8 small-10 small-centered columns font-grey">
      The average business owner's experience with the trademarking process varies
      so much that it made sense to break the service up into levels
      (we called them packages) based on how much hand-holding a customer prefers.
      We modeled this structure after TurboTax, as users can self-select
      the desired level of help they receive when filing taxes online.
      Multi-tiered pricing also lets Trust Tree price anchor against themselves,
      rather than the competition.
