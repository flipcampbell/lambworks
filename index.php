            <p>
              Lambworks is a solo product design consultancy, for entrepreneurs
              building digital products and online services.
            </p>
              <p>
              It's run by me, Holly Stewart, with help from friends as needed.
              </p>
            	<p>
            	I began doing design and marketing in the corporate-cubicle-world for three years. After deciding that office politics and inefficient bureaucracy are not for me, I voluntarily escaped to go solo during a recession, while all of my colleagues were desperately clinging to their jobs.</p>
				<p>
                Since then, I’ve spent six years helping startups and small businesses with design, strategy, and occasionally self-sabotage prevention. I prefer working with startups because we share a drive to carve your own path while making useful and profitable things.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  Unlike other consultancies, I only accept projects from early
                  stage startups when it's clear I can provide a return on
                  investment by growing traction or revenue.
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                This allows me to solve core issues
                <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> any time and
                resources are thrown at a deeper business problem or unprofitable idea.

               Looking for someone who will just execute the idea in your head?
             </h5>
             <p>
               If you're in the market for order takers, pixel pushers, or code
               monkeys, this is not a good fit.
             </p>
             <p>
               I choose and assemble setups where everyone is involved in prioritization every step of the way. No
               one is left in the dark and input is not only encouraged, but
               required. We collaborate as strategists, advisors, and lead
               technicians.
             </p>
             <p>
               We don't build for the sake of building. We commit to building your product to solve a need, want, or problem for your customers.

             <p>
               Are you against doing content marketing such as newsletters, blogging,
               or interviews?
             </p>
             <p>
               This tells me you have a "build it and they will come" mentality.
             </p>
             <p>
               If you aren't committed enough to build an audience and write a
               weekly or monthly blog post or newsletter, why should I or your
               customers take your business seriously?
